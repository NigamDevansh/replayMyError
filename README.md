## 🚧 Work in Progress

Hey there! 👋

This project is **actively being developed**. I'm building something exciting here — a tool that helps developers understand exactly what users did before an error occurred.

### What's Coming

- Click & input tracking
- Navigation monitoring
- Network request logging  
- React component detection
- Privacy-first sanitization
- Structured JSON error reports

Stay tuned for updates! Once the core features are stable and ready for use, I'll publish full documentation and usage examples here.
